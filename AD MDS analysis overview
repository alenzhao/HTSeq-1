AD 1000G analysis

Compare to 1000G phase 3 data  
  
1. Make a list of overlapping SNPs between AD trio and 1000G  
  
Use cat and cut to make lists of SNPs from the 1000G vcfs and AD vcfs  
Sort the lists of SNPs using the sort command  
  
eg. cat ../../1000G/phase3_all_SNPs_list.txt | sort > ../../1000G/phase3_all_SNPs_list.sorted.txt  
  
Use comm (the unix compare command) to find the union between the SNP sets.  
  
comm -1 -2 ../../1000G/phase3_all_SNPs_list.sorted.txt ../../anno/AD/AD_QC_genome_SNPs_for_PCA.sorted.txt > 1000G_AD_union_SNPs_all.txt  
  
-1 means exclude SNPs unique to the first file  
-2 means exclude SNPs unique to the second file  
  
Check the length of the lists:  
  
[kelliott@rescomp2 AD_MDS]$ cat ../../1000G/phase3_all_SNPs_list.sorted.txt | wc -l  
84739838  
[kelliott@rescomp2 AD_MDS]$ cat ../../anno/AD/AD_QC_genome_SNPs_for_PCA.sorted.txt | wc -l  
5995864  
[kelliott@rescomp2 AD_MDS]$ cat 1000G_AD_union_SNPs_all.txt | wc -l  
5457850  
  
Sizes correlate with expected.
